# Welcome to NodeBoats at JS Conf 2018!

### Getting Started

As part of this workshop, you should divide up into teams of 3-4 people. Try to find people with a similar boat "vision" as you to partner with.

There will be two different boat models that each team can make as part of the NodeBoats workshop. One is a motor-propelled boat, and the other is a paddle boat. Each kit should have all supplies needed for either type of boat! Keep in mind that the motor-propelled boat does require some soldering, so keep this in mind when deciding which kind of propulsion you want for your boat!

Each boat kit will include the following materials. Make sure you let us know if any components are missing! (Please also keep in mind that we do need the parts back at the end of the day!)
